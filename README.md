# Ray Tracing Demo (with GPGPU)

This repo is for the project of GPGPU course.

The code is largely based on [Ray Tracing in One Weekend Book Series](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io) with some modification, which runs on CPU. 
A GPGPU version is then ported from the CPU version with CUDA programming, thus achieving a huge amount of speed up.
